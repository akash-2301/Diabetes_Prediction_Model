 # Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a predictive model using machine learning techniques to determine whether a person is likely to have disease based on diagnostic measurements. The dataset used is the well-known **PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset**.

## 🔍 Overview

- The aim is to assist in the early diagnosis of diabetes using supervised learning models.
- This project applies SVM machine learning algorithms to compare their effectiveness in prediction.
- It includes data preprocessing, visualization, model training, evaluation, and conclusion.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source:** [PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
- **Features:**
  - Pregnancies
  - Glucose
  - Blood Pressure
  - Skin Thickness
  - Insulin
  - BMI
  - Diabetes Pedigree Function
  - Age
  - Outcome (Target Variable: 0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy, Pandas
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (for ML algorithms and evaluation)

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Distribution plots and correlation heatmaps
- Detection and handling of outliers and missing values
- Feature scaling and transformation

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used

- SVM Classifier

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- ROC-AUC (optional for binary classification)

## 🧪 Results

- The models were trained and tested using an 80/20 train-test split.
- Best performing models were selected based on accuracy and interpretability.
